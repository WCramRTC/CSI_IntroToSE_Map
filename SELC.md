The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. The SDLC aims to produce software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates. Here's a summarized breakdown of the SDLC, including a table of contents for easy navigation:

### Planning
The planning phase is crucial for defining project goals, scope, procedures, and potential constraints. It involves determining the resources required and planning the team roles and responsibilities.

### Analysis
The analysis phase involves gathering detailed business requirements from the customer to define and document clear project objectives. It's about understanding what needs to be created and the problem the software will solve.

### Design
In the design phase, the software's architecture is designed. This includes defining the software's overall structure, its components, and how they interact with each other. Design choices cover platform, programming languages, and tools.

### Implementation
The implementation or coding phase is where the actual software development takes place. Developers write code according to the previously defined specifications and design documents.

### Testing
During the testing phase, the software is tested for defects or bugs. Testers aim to identify any issues in the software and verify that it meets the initial specifications. This phase is critical for ensuring the quality of the software.

### Deployment
Once the software is tested and ready for release, it enters the deployment phase. The software is deployed to a live environment for use by the end-users. This might involve a phased approach or a full rollout.

### Maintenance
After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. During this time, any necessary updates, modifications, and patches are made to ensure the software continues to perform as expected. This phase also addresses any issues end-users may encounter.
